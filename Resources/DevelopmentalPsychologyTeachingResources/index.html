<p class='vspace'><strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong> has on-line course materials for Developmental Psychology in the section of Brain and Cognitive Sciences <a href='http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/#brain-and-cognitive-sciences'>Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<p><strong><a href='http://www.learner.org/resources/series54.html'>Seasons of Life</a></strong> is a series of instructional video in developmental psychology for college and high school students; 5 one-hour video programs and 26 half-hour audio programs.
The programs are an introduction to developmental psychology from conception through old age. The series explores the biological, psychological, and social "clocks" of life-span. Psychologists, sociologists, biologists, and anthropologists present theory, methods, and research. Real individuals from diverse backgrounds talk about the significant events in their lives. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<p><strong><a href='http://www.learner.org/resources/series84.html'>Growing Old in a New Age</a></strong> is a series of 13 one-hour video programs on aging for college and high school students.
The programs show the impact of aging on both society and individuals as diverse elders relate their experiences. The four ways that age is measured — chronologically, biologically, psychologically, and socially — are the basis for discussing the quality of life in later years. The programs examine common misconceptions about aging and provides a springboard for analyzing new roles for elders, intergenerational alliances, resource allocation, and artificial attempts to prolong life. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<p><strong><a href='http://www.learner.org/resources/series108.html'>Death: A Personal Understanding</a></strong> is a series of 10 half-hour video programs on death and dying for college and high school students.
The programs give a greater understanding of death and dying through case studies and moving personal stories of people facing their own death or the death of a loved one. The programs explore a wide range of North American cultural perspectives on death within the context of current issues, including AIDS, death by violence, suicide, assisted suicide, hospice care, end-of-life decision making, and how children react to death.
