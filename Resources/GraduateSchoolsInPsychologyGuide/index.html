<p><strong><a href='http://www.bestcolleges.com/features/best-online-masters-psychology-programs/'>Master's in psychology: Best online programs</a></strong> An online master's program in psychology over a traditional on-campus program can benefit a wide array of students. The focus of psychology degrees varies greatly, so it is sometimes hard to find a program well suited to an applicant's professional aspirations and needs. For example, the field of Industrial-Organizational Psychology has the fast occupational growth rates: 53% by 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Local schools, however, may not offer the type of program necessary to enter this field.
Studying in a master's in psychology program online permits candidates to pick from a large selection of schools and find the exact specialty they need. This provides an opportunity to get the necessary credentials without relocating. Also, an online program can be individualized to suit various scheduling needs and goals while offering a focused and supportive learning environment. The website ranks the best online master's in psychology.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<p><strong><a href='http://mastersinpsychologyguide.com/'>Go further in psychology</a></strong> A master's degree in psychology is important for graduates because bachelor's degree give limited career options. To practice as a school psychologist, licensed counselor or an industrial-organizational psychologist, for example, it is needed to have a master's degree. A graduate also needs at least a master's degree to practice as a clinical psychologist under a senior clinical psychologist with a doctorate. To practice on one's own, the master's degree will be a stepping stone to earning your doctoral degree.

Over the past few years, the value of a college degree has been questioned, though perhaps not quite so harshly as the Ph.D. While criticisms of doctoral study have not been entirely unfounded (Ph.D.s are struggling a bit more in the current job market than they have in years past) the reality is that earning a doctorate in most fields can be a solid career move that offers potential for advancement and can potentially open up entirely new career avenues.
